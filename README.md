# SE-Crowd-Management
### SE project for crowd management at POS terminals
Retailers who are unable to mitigate challenges that come in the way to provide a seamless billing experience to their customers are more likely to suffer. They can lose customers and thus sales. The intended audience includes the customer waiting in line for their turn at the billing counters and also the retail store management to detect overcrowding and to simply fast track the billing processes so that the customer need not wait for long.<br/>
Crowd monitoring systems (CMSs) provide a state-of-the-art solution to manage large crowds objectively. In recent years, researchers have discovered the potential of CMSs for crowd behavior research and have started to leverage CMSs to derive new insights regarding crowd movement behavior. The crowd state (i.e., walking velocity, density, and flow rate) at a retail outlet can be effectively determined using a comprehensive CMS.


Initial implementation starts from a skeleton of the product by simulating a prototype of our product using Arduino board and IR sensors.<br/>
We came up with the prototype for one terminal working independently, and later created more terminals and integrated them to work in cohesion and effectively manage the crowd at POS terminals. Using the Iterative SDLC model helped us identify requirements and visualize the solution.  This also provided support for risk mitigation, incremental investment, reduced rework  and feature creeps and lastly, increased customer engagement.

# Tools Used
IR simulation on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).

# How to use
Create an account on tinkercad and design your simulator using Arduino board and IR sensors as shown in the figure below. Then paste code from the crowd_management_pos_fully_commented.ino file and simply click simulate :)
